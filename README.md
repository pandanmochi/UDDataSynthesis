# UDDataSynthesis
A single table data synthesizer that I have developed for my bachelor thesis. It is based on the data synthesizer included
in the "AITEST" framework built by IBM, which has been introduced in a scientific publication published by Saha et al. [1] 
The paper describes the framework's functionality and the data synthesis process in detail.

The synthesizer works for single tables that include categorical and numerical data.
